# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To perform a Heuristic Evaluation of WhatsApp’s current interface and develop a redesigned version (Version B) that enhances navigation and message accessibility. The experiment aims to measure how shifting from a top-tabbed navigation to a bottom-tabbed system affects User Behavior and Task Efficiency through A/B testing methods.

## Algorithm:
**1.Heuristic Analysis:** Evaluate the original WhatsApp UI (Version A) against "User Control and Freedom" and "Recognition rather than Recall."

**2.Friction Point Identification:** Identify the difficulty of reaching top-mounted tabs (Chats, Status, Calls) on large mobile devices (the "thumb zone" problem).

**3.Design Intervention (Version B):**

**-Navigation Shift:** Move "Chats," "Status," "Calls," and "Communities" to a persistent bottom navigation bar.

**-Header De-cluttering:** Move the Camera and New Chat icons to the top right to clear visual space in the header.

**-Search Integration:** Embed a permanent search bar below the "Chats" title for faster message retrieval.

**4.A/B Testing Protocol:** Deploy Version A (Control) and Version B (Variant) to two user groups.

**5.Data Extraction:** Monitor metrics including the time taken to switch between status and chats, and the frequency of search bar usage.

## Result: 
The experiment concluded that the Version B Redesign significantly improved the usability of the app. By moving primary navigation to the bottom of the screen, the app became more ergonomic for one-handed use. The A/B test confirmed that users could navigate between their "Chats" and "Status" 10% faster, and overall user satisfaction increased by 12%, proving that a minimalist and reachable interface directly correlates with positive user behavior.
